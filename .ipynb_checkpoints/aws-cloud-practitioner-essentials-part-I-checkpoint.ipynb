    "### Client-Server Model\n",
    "In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A **server** can be services such as *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud Computing\n",
    "Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.\n",
    "- On-demand: anytime, flexible\n",
    "- IT resources: all kinds of products for undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT, tasks that are common, repeatetive, and time-comsuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deployment models for cloud computing\n",
    "The three cloud computing deployment models are **cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid**. \n",
    "- On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment.\n",
    "- Hybrid deployment connects cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure and integrates cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of cloud computing\n",
    "- Trade upfront expense for variable expense\n",
    "- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers (and focus more on your applications and customers)\n",
    "- Stop guessing capacity (pay-as-you-go)\n",
    "- Benefit from massive economies of scale\n",
    "- Increase speed and agility (Cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.)\n",
    "- Go global in minutes (low latency)"

    "### Amazone Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc) provides secure, resizable **compute capacity** in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances. **Amazon EC2** offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Fundemantally, Amazon EC2 is a server, or a virtual machine, which is equivalent to the Azure Virtual Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Azazon EC2 instance types\n",
    "##### General purpose instances\n",
    "General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compute optimized instances\n",
    "Compute optimized applications are ideal for ***high-performance web servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers***. You can also use compute optimized instances for ***batch processing*** workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Momory optimized instances\n",
    "Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets **in memory**. In computing, memory is a temporary storage area. It holds all the data and instructions that a central processing unit (CPU) needs to be able to complete actions. Before a computer program or application is able to run, it is loaded from storage into memory. This preloading process gives the CPU direct access to the computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Accelerated computing instances\n",
    "Accelerated computing instances use **hardware accelerators, or coprocessors**, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. Examples of these functions include ***floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching***.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Storage optimized instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require **high, sequential read and write access** to large datasets on local storage. Examples of workloads suitable for storage optimized instances include ***distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems***. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, the term **input/output operations per second (IOPS)** is a metric that measures the performance of a storage device. It indicates how many different input or output operations a device can perform in one second. **Storage optimized instances are designed to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random IOPS to applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amazon EC2 Pricing\n",
    "##### On-Demand\n",
    "On-Demand Instances are ideal for **short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted**. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample use cases for On-Demand Instances include developing and testing applications and running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns. On-Demand Instances are not recommended for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads can experience greater cost savings using Reserved Instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Saving Plans\n",
    "Amazon EC2 Savings Plans enable you to reduce your compute costs by **committing to a consistent amount of compute usage** for a ***1-year*** or ***3-year*** term. This term commitment results in savings of up to 72% over On-Demand costs. Any usage up to the commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plan rate (for example, 10 dollars an hour). Any usage beyond the commitment is charged at regular On-Demand rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reserved Instances\n",
    "Reserved Instances are a **billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account**. You can purchase **Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved** Instances for either a ***1-year*** or ***3-year term***, and **Scheduled Reserved** Instances for a ***1-year*** term. You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spot Instances\n",
    "Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with **flexible start and end times**, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dedicated Hosts\n",
    "Dedicated Hosts are **physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use**. You can use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to help maintain license compliance. You can purchase On-Demand Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Hosts Reservations. Of all the Amazon EC2 options that were covered, **Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scaling Amazon EC2\n",
    "**Scalability** involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in. If you wanted the scaling process to happen automatically, which AWS service would you use? The AWS service that provides this functionality for Amazon EC2 instances is **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic scaling** responds to changing demand. \n",
    "- **Predictive scaling** automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale faster, you can use dynamic scaling and predictive scaling together.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\n",
    "When you create an **Auto Scaling group**, you can set the **minimum number** of Amazon EC2 instances. The minimum capacity is the number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group. In this example, the Auto Scaling group has a minimum capacity of one Amazon EC2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can set the **desired capacity** at two Amazon EC2 instances even though your application needs a minimum of a single Amazon EC2 instance to run. *If you do not specify the desired number of Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The third configuration that you can set in an Auto Scaling group is the **maximum capacity**. For example, you might configure the Auto Scaling group to scale out in response to increased demand, but only to a maximum of four Amazon EC2 instances."

    "### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)\n",
    "\n",
    "A load balancer is an application that takes in requests and routes them to the instances to be processed. **Elastic Load Balancing** is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group. This means that as you add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to the amount of incoming traffic, these requests route to the load balancer first. Then, the requests spread across multiple resources that will handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "ELB is **automatically scalable**. As your traffic grows, ELB is designed to handle the additional throughput with no change to the hourly cost. When your EC2 fleet auto-scales out, as each instance comes online, the auto-scaling service just lets the Elastic Load Balancing service know that it's ready to handle the traffic, and off it goes. Once the fleet scales in, ELB first stops all new traffic, and waits for the existing requests to complete, to drain out. Once they do that, then the auto-scaling engine can terminate the instances without disruption to existing customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we solve the back end traffic chaos with an ELB as well. Because ELB is regional, it's a single URL that each front end instance uses. Then the ELB directs traffic to the back end that has the least outstanding requests. Now, if the back end scales, once the new instance is ready, it just tells the ELB that it can take traffic, and it gets to work. The front end doesn't know and doesn't care how many back end instances are running. This is true decoupled architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messaging and Queuing\n",
    "\n",
    "*This idea of placing messages into a buffer is called* ***messaging and queuing***. Just as our cashier sends orders to the barista, applications send messages to each other to communicate. If applications communicate directly like our cashier and barista previously, this is called being **tightly coupled**. This type of architecture can be considered a **monolithic application**. A hallmark trait of a tightly coupled architecture is where if a single component fails or changes, it causes issues for other components or even the whole system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more reliable architecture is **loosely coupled**. In a **microservices** approach, application components are loosely coupled. This is an architecture where if one component fails, it is isolated and therefore won't cause cascading failures throughout the whole system. In this case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other. The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing. **Message Queue** is a buffer between applications in the loosely-coupled architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amazon services for messaging and queuing\n",
    "**Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)** is a message queuing service. Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)** is a **publish/subscribe service**. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers. This is similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks. In Amazon SNS, subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options. \n"

    "### Additional compute services\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Serverless Computing\n",
    "The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. Serverless means that you cannot actually see or access the underlying infrastructure or instances that are hosting your application. Instead, all the management of the underlying environment from a provisioning, scaling, high availability, and maintenance perspective are taken care of for you. All you need to do is focus on your application and the rest is taken care of. \n",
    "\n",
    "**AWS Lambda** is a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "While using AWS Lambda, you **pay only for the compute time that you consume**. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple Lambda function might involve automatically resizing uploaded images to the AWS Cloud. In this case, **the function** triggers when uploading a new image. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Containers\n",
    "A container is a package for your code where you package up your application, its dependencies as well as any configurations that it needs to run. Containers provide you with a standard way to package your application's code and dependencies into a single object. You can also use containers for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running containerized applications, it’s important to consider scalability. Suppose that instead of a single host with multiple containers, you have to manage tens of hosts with hundreds of containers. Alternatively, you have to manage possibly hundreds of hosts with thousands of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc&ecs-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&ecs-blogs.sort-order=desc) is a highly scalable, high-performance **container management system** that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon ECS supports **Docker containers**. Docker is a software platform that enables you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. AWS supports the use of open-source Docker Community Edition and subscription-based Docker Enterprise Edition. With Amazon ECS, you can use API calls to launch and stop Docker-enabled applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)** is a fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kubernetes** is open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. A large community of volunteers maintains Kubernetes, and AWS actively works together with the Kubernetes community. As new features and functionalities release for Kubernetes applications, you can easily apply these updates to your applications managed by Amazon EKS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AWS Fargate** is a **serverless compute engine for containers**. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers. AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you. You can focus more on innovating and developing your applications, and you pay only for the resources that are required to run your containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual Machine vs Functions vs Containers on AWS\n",
    "If you are trying to **host traditional applications** and want full access to the underlying operating system like Linux or Windows, you are going to want to use **EC2**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking to host **short running functions**, service-oriented or event driven applications and you don't want to manage the underlying environment at all, look into the **serverless AWS Lambda**. \n",

    "- **Regions** are geographically isolated areas, where you can access services needed to run your enterprise.\n",
    "- Regions contain **Availability Zones**, that allow you to run across physically separated buildings, tens of miles of separation, while keeping your application logically unified. Availability Zones help you solve high availability and disaster recovery scenarios, without any additional effort on your part.\n",
    "- **AWS Edge locations** run **Amazon CloudFront** to help get content closer to your customers, no matter where they are in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Region\n",
    "When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors. \n",
    "- Compliance\n",
    "- Proximity to your customers\n",
    "- Service/feature availability\n",
    "- Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Availibility Zones\n",
    "An **Availability Zone** is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close enough to have low latency (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones. However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Locations\n",
    "#### Amazon CloudFornt\n",
    "An **edge location** is a site that **Amazon CloudFront**, a content delivery network, uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching copies of data closer to the customers all around the world uses the concept of content delivery networks, or CDNs. CDNs are commonly used, and on AWS, we call our CDN Amazon CloudFront. Amazon CloudFront is a service that helps deliver data, video, applications, and APIs to customers around the world with low latency and high transfer speeds. Amazon CloudFront uses what are called Edge locations, all around the world, to help accelerate communication with users, no matter where they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS outposts\n",
    "With **AWS Outposts**, AWS will basically install a fully operational mini Region, right inside your own data center. That's owned and operated by AWS, using 100% of AWS functionality, but isolated within your own building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provision AWS Resources\n",
    "#### AWS Management Console\n",
    "The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the AWS Console mobile application to perform tasks such as monitoring resources, viewing alarms, and accessing billing information. Multiple identities can stay logged into the AWS Console mobile app at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS Command Line Interfact (CLI)\n",
    "To save time when making API requests, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "By using AWS CLI, you can automate the actions that your services and applications perform through scripts. For example, you can use commands to launch an Amazon EC2 instance, connect an Amazon EC2 instance to a specific Auto Scaling group, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Software Development Kits (SDK)\n",
    "Another option for accessing and managing AWS services is the software development kits (SDKs). SDKs make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform. SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started with using SDKs, AWS provides documentation and sample code for each supported programming language. Supported programming languages include C++, Java, .NET, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n",
    "With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjust capacity\n",
    "- Load balancing\n",
    "- Automatic scaling\n",
    "- Application health monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS CloudFormation\n",
    "AWS CloudFormation is an ***infrastructure as code*** tool that allows you to define a wide variety of AWS resources in **a declarative way using JSON or YAML text-based documents** called **CloudFormation templates**. A declarative format like this allows you to define what you want to build without specifying the details of exactly how to build it. CloudFormation lets you **define what you want** and the CloudFormation engine will worry about the details on calling APIs to get everything built out. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also isn't just limited to EC2-based solutions. CloudFormation supports many different AWS resources from storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more. Once you define your resources in a CloudFormation template, CloudFormation will parse the template and begin provisioning all the resources you defined in parallel. CloudFormation manages all the calls to the backend AWS APIs for you. You can run the same CloudFormation template in multiple accounts or multiple regions, and it will create identical environments across them. There is less room for human error as it is a totally automated process. "

    "### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n",
    "**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud**, or VPCs, lets you provision a **logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud** where you can launch AWS resources **in a virtual network** that you define. These resources can be **public facing** so they have access to the internet, or **private with no internet access**, usually for backend services like databases or application servers. The public and private grouping of resources are known as **subnets (public subnet or private subnet)** and they are **ranges of IP addresses in your VPC**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Connectivity to AWS VPC\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internet Gateway (IGW)\n",
    "In order to allow traffic from the public internet to flow into and out of your VPC, you must attach what is called an **internet gateway, or IGW**, to your VPC. An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. You can think of an internet gateway as being similar to a doorway that customers use to enter the coffee shop. Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual Private Gateway\n",
    "To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how a virtual private gateway works. You can think of the internet as the road between your home and the coffee shop. Suppose that you are traveling on this road with a bodyguard to protect you. You are still using the same road as other customers, but with an extra layer of protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bodyguard is like a **virtual private network (VPN) connection** that encrypts (or protects) your internet traffic from all the other requests around it. ***A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC. Even though your connection to the coffee shop has extra protection, traffic jams are possible because you’re using the same road as other customers. **VPN connections are private and they are encrypted, but they still use a regular internet connection that has bandwidth that is being shared by many people using the internet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS Direct Connect\n",
    "AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish **a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC**. Suppose that there is an apartment building with a hallway directly linking the building to the coffee shop. Only the residents of the apartment building can travel through this hallway. This private hallway provides the same type of dedicated connection as AWS Direct Connect. Residents are able to get into the coffee shop without needing to use the public road shared with other customers. The private connection that AWS Direct Connect provides helps you to reduce network costs and increase the amount of bandwidth that can travel through your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a completely private, dedicated fiber connection from your data center to AWS. You work with a Direct Connect partner in your area to establish this connection, because like my magic doorway, AWS Direct Connect provides **a physical line** that connects your network to your AWS VPC. This can help you meet high regulatory and compliance needs, as well as sidestep any potential bandwidth issues. It's also important to note that one VPC might have multiple types of gateways attached for multiple types of resources all residing in the same VPC, just in different subnets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Subnets\n",
    "***The only technical reason to use subnets in a VPC is to control access to the gateways.*** The public subnets have access to the internet gateway; the private subnets do not.\n",
    "- Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website.\n",
    "- Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers’ personal information and order histories. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. For example, you might have an application that involves Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network access control list (ACLs)\n",
    "A **network access control list (ACL)** is **a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the *subnet level***. Subnets can also control traffic permissions. **Packets** are messages from the internet, and every packet that crosses the subnet boundaries gets checked against something called a **network access control list or network ACL**. This check is to see if the packet has permissions to either leave or enter the subnet based on who it was sent from and how it's trying to communicate. And just because you were let in doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna let you out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each AWS account includes a default network ACL. When configuring your VPC, you can use your account’s default network ACL or create custom network ACLs. **By default, your account’s default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic**, but you can modify it by adding your own rules. **For custom network ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow.** Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn’t match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Group\n",
    "A network ACL only gets to evaluate a packet if it crosses a subnet boundary, in or out. It doesn't evaluate if a packet can reach **a specific EC2 instance** or not. To solve instance level access questions, we introduce **security groups**. A **security group** is **a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon *EC2 instance***. *Every EC2 instance, when it's launched, automatically comes with a security group.* And ***by default, the security group does not allow any traffic into the instance at all***. All ports are blocked; all IP addresses sending packets are blocked. You can modify the security group to accept a specific type of traffic. **With security groups, you allow specific traffic in and by default, all traffic is allowed out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ACLs vs. Security Group \n",
    "The key difference between a security group and a network ACL is the ***security group is stateful***, meaning, as we talked about, it has some kind of a memory when it comes to who to allow in or out, and the ***network ACL is stateless***, which remembers nothing and checks every single packet that crosses its border regardless of any circumstances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of sending a packet between two instances in different subnet:\n",
    "- Stateful: Security group recognize the packet when sending out and automatically grant access when receiving\n",
    "- Stateless: Network ACL doesn't recognice and checks everytime for all outgoing and incoming packets\n",
    "\n",
    "Good network security will take advantage of both **network ACLs** and **security groups**, because security in-depth is critical for modern architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Route 53\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that AnyCompany has a website hosted in the AWS Cloud. Customers enter the web address into their browser, and they are able to access the website. This happens because of **Domain Name System (DNS)** resolution. **DNS resolution involves a *DNS server communicatin*g with a *web server***. You can think of DNS as being the phone book of the internet. DNS resolution is the process of **translating a *domain name* to an *IP address***. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE: Because of domain name system, different web address could reach the same site. This makes tracking the web traffic on a particular site with tags possible!\n",

    "**Amazon Route 53** is a **DNS web service**. It gives developers and businesses a reliable way to **route end users to internet applications hosted in AWS**. Amazon Route 53 connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS (such as Amazon EC2 instances and load balancers). It can route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names. You can register new domain names directly in Route 53. You can also transfer DNS records for existing domain names managed by other domain registrars. This enables you to manage all of your domain names within a single location.\n",

    "Route 53 can direct traffic to different endpoints using several different routing policies, such as \n",

    "- geolocation DNS,\n",
    "- geoproximity,\n",
    "- and weighted round robin."
