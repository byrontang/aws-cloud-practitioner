    "## Module 7: Monitoring and Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amazon CloudWatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch is a **web service** that enables you to **monitor and manage various metrics** and **configure alarm actions** based on data from those metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudWatch uses **metrics** to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### CloudWatch alarms\n",
    "\n",
    "With CloudWatch, you can create alarms that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that your company’s developers use Amazon EC2 instances for application development or testing purposes. If the developers occasionally forget to stop the instances, the instances will continue to run and incur charges. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, you could create a CloudWatch alarm that automatically stops an Amazon EC2 instance when the CPU utilization percentage has remained below a certain threshold for a specified period. When configuring the alarm, you can specify to receive a notification whenever this alarm is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CloudWatch dashboard\n",
    "The CloudWatch dashboard feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location. For example, you can use a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPU utilization of an Amazon EC2 instance, the total number of requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket, and more. You can even customize separate dashboards for different business purposes, applications, or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amazon CloudTrail\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS CloudTrail **records API calls for your account**. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, and more. You can think of CloudTrail as a “trail” of breadcrumbs (or **a log of actions**) that someone has left behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that you can use API calls to provision, manage, and configure your AWS resources. With CloudTrail, you can view **a complete history of user activity and API calls** for your applications and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Events are typically updated in CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call. You can filter events by specifying the time and date that an API call occurred, the user who requested the action, the type of resource that was involved in the API call, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CloudTrail Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Within CloudTrail, you can also enable CloudTrail Insights. This optional feature allows CloudTrail to **automatically detect unusual API activities in your AWS account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, CloudTrail Insights might detect that a higher number of Amazon EC2 instances than usual have recently launched in your account. You can then review the full event details to determine which actions you need to take next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Trusted Advisor\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Trusted Advisor is a web service that inspects your **AWS environment** and provides real-time recommendations in accordance with AWS best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trusted Advisor **compares its findings to AWS best practices** in five categories: **cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits**. For the checks in each category, Trusted Advisor offers a list of recommended actions and additional resources to learn more about AWS best practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The guidance provided by AWS Trusted Advisor can benefit your company at all stages of deployment. For example, you can use AWS Trusted Advisor to assist you while you are creating new workflows and developing new applications. Or you can use it while you are making ongoing improvements to existing applications and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS Trusted Advisor dashboard\n",
    "When you access the Trusted Advisor dashboard on the AWS Management Console, you can review completed checks for cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits.\n",
    "- The green check indicates the number of items for which it detected no problems.\n",
    "- The orange triangle represents the number of recommended investigations.\n",
    "- The red circle represents the number of recommended actions."

    "## Module 8: Pricing and Support\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Free Tier\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Free Tier enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. Three types of offers are available: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always Free**: These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers. For example, AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **12 Months Free**: These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS. Examples include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trials**: Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service. For example, Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial. Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each free tier offer, make sure to review the specific details about exactly which resource types are included. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with pay-as-you-go pricing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pay for what you use\n",
    "For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pay less when you reserve\n",
    "Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that your company is using Amazon EC2 instances for a workload that needs to run continuously. You might choose to run this workload on Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans, because the plan allows you to save up to 72% over the equivalent On-Demand Instance capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more\n",
    "Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the more Amazon S3 storage space you use, the less you pay for it per GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Pricing Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can organize your AWS estimates **by groups that you define**. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center. When you have created an estimate, you can save it and generate a link to share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that your company is interested in using Amazon EC2. However, you are not yet sure which AWS Region or instance type would be the most cost-efficient for your use case. In the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can enter details such as the kind of operating system you need, memory requirements, and input/output (I/O) requirements. By using the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS Regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.\n",
    "- With Amazon EC2, you pay for only the compute time that you use while your instances are running. For some workloads, you can significantly reduce Amazon EC2 costs by using Spot Instances. For example, suppose that you are running a batch processing job that is able to withstand interruptions. Using a Spot Instance would provide you with up to 90% cost savings while still meeting the availability requirements of your workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Billing dashboard\n",
    "Use the AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare your current month-to-date balance with the previous month, and get a forecast of the next month based on current usage.\n",
    "- View month-to-date spend by service.\n",
    "- View Free Tier usage by service.\n",
    "- Access Cost Explorer and create budgets.\n",
    "- Purchase and manage Savings Plans.\n",
    "- Publish AWS Cost and Usage Reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consolidated billing\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier module, you learned about AWS Organizations, a service that enables you to manage multiple AWS accounts from a central location. AWS Organizations also provides the option for consolidated billing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations** enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization. By consolidating, you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization. **The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4**, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On your monthly bill, you can review itemized charges incurred by each account. This enables you to have greater transparency into your organization’s accounts while still maintaining the convenience of receiving a single monthly bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of consolidated billing is **the ability to share bulk discount pricing**, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances across the accounts in your organization. For instance, one account might not have enough monthly usage to qualify for discount pricing. However, when multiple accounts are combined, their aggregated usage may result in a benefit that applies across all accounts in the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Budgets\n",
    "\n",
    "In AWS Budgets, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations. The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits. In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Cost Explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Support\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS offers four different Support plans to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Support is free for all AWS customers. It includes access to **whitepapers, documentation, and support communities**. With Basic Support, you can also **contact AWS for billing questions and service limit increases**. With Basic Support, you have access to a limited selection of **AWS Trusted Advisor** checks. Additionally, you can use the **AWS Personal Health Dashboard**, a tool that provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Developer, Business, and Enterprise Support\n",
    "\n",
    "The Developer, Business, and Enterprise Support plans include all the benefits of Basic Support, in addition to the ability to open an unrestricted number of technical support cases. These three Support plans have **pay-by-the-month pricing** and require **no long-term contracts**. In general, for pricing, the Developer plan has the lowest cost, the Business plan is in the middle, and the Enterprise plan has the highest cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Developer Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers in the Developer Support plan have access to features such as:\n",
    "- Best practice guidance\n",
    "- Client-side diagnostic tools\n",
    "- Building-block architecture support, which consists of guidance for how to use AWS offerings, features, and services together\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Business Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers with a Business Support plan have access to additional features, including: \n",
    "- Use-case guidance to identify AWS offerings, features, and services that can best support your specific needs\n",
    "- **All AWS Trusted Advisor checks**\n",
    "- Limited support for third-party software, such as common operating systems and application stack components\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Enterprise Support\n",
    "In addition to all the features included in the Basic, Developer, and Business Support plans, customers with an Enterprise Support plan have access to features such as:\n",
    "- Application architecture guidance, which is a consultative relationship to support your company’s specific use cases and applications\n",
    "- Infrastructure event management: A short-term engagement with AWS Support that helps your company gain a better understanding of your use cases. This also provides your company with architectural and scaling guidance.\n",
    "- A **Technical Account Manager**\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Technical Account Manager (TAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your company has an Enterprise Support plan, the TAM is your primary point of contact at AWS. They provide guidance, architectural reviews, and ongoing communication with your company as you plan, deploy, and optimize your applications. Your TAM provides expertise across the full range of AWS services. They help you design solutions that efficiently use multiple services together through an integrated approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that you are interested in developing an application that uses several AWS services together. Your TAM could provide insights into how to best use the services together. They achieve this, while aligning with the specific needs that your company is hoping to address through the new application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Marketplace\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog that includes thousands of **software listings from independent software vendors**. You can use AWS Marketplace to find, test, and buy software that runs on AWS. For each listing in AWS Marketplace, you can access detailed information on pricing options, available support, and reviews from other AWS customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also explore software solutions by industry and use case. For example, suppose that your company is in the healthcare industry. In AWS Marketplace, you can review use cases that software helps you to address, such as implementing solutions to protect patient records or using machine learning models to analyze a patient’s medical history and predict possible health risks."

    "### MIgration Strategies - 6 Rs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rehosting** also known as “lift-and-shift” involves moving applications without changes. In the scenario of a large legacy migration, in which the company is looking to implement its migration and scale quickly to meet a business case, the majority of applications are rehosted. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Replatforming**, also known as “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rehosting and replatforming do not really use AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retiring** is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retaining** consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repurchasing** involves moving from a traditional license to a ***software-as-a-service model***. For example, a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating from a customer relationship management (CRM) system to Salesforce.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refactoring** (also known as **re-architecting**) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by ***using cloud-native features***. Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.

    "### The AWS Well-Architected Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operational excellence\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational excellence is **the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include **performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:\n",
    "- Automate security best practices when possible.\n",
    "- Apply security at all layers.\n",
    "- Protect data in transit and at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is the ability of a system to do the following:\n",
    "- **Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions**\n",
    "- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand\n",
    "- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes **experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value **at the lowest price point**. Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.\n",
